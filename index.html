        </h3>
        <p>
          Lots of big changes to the website today, so let's go into all of them!
        </p>
        <p>
          First and foremost, I'm going to be starting a new weekly release of puzzles! After the New York Times locked the Mini crossword behind a subscription fee (boo!), many friends of mine have no way to satisfy their tiny puzzle craving. What I am going to try and keep up with doing is releasing three smaller crossword puzzles (the Bit, the Nibble, and the Bite) every Monday for you all to complete at some point during the week. I don't have a leaderboard hosted here, but you're more than welcome to try and beat these puzzles as fast as you can! These puzzles will be similar to the NYT Mini, but I'm gonna be trying to put my own spin on things. I've got some fun ideas cooking up in my brain. The first batch of weekly puzzles are out <a href="weeklybits.html">NOW</a>, so go check them out!
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I have a couple more big boy puzzles to upload here. One of them is another <a href="imnotstupid.html">pop culture-filled Friday puzzle</a> that references Fortnite, Severence, and a 2016 meme you've all forgotten about. The other is a <a href="thissongslaps.html">chill Tuesday puzzle</a> that, now that I'm looking at it, also has a good amount of pop culture in it (Star Wars, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Super Smash Bros to name a few).
        </p>
        <p>
          Last on the docket is a less exciting but pretty cool addition. As many of you know, I am in college for game design right now. I've got quite a few projects under my belt and am currently working on at least 3 more that I can name. If you're interested, <a href="portfolio.html">my portfolio</a> is now being hosted on this site, so you can check it out if you're a game studio executive or just really bored.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addition of weekly puzzles should force me to update this site on a more consistent basis, so I'll probably be spacing out the release of my bigger puzzles a bit more. That or I'll immediately bail on updating the site weekly when it gets too tedious. We'll see what happens. Happy solving everyone!
