        </h3>
        <p>
          Hello all! I hope you're having a wonderful week so far. I'm excited to get into this week's puzzles, so let's do that!
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="weeklybits.html">Week 24 of weekly puzzles</a> have arrived! Best of luck to you all with them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I'd like to give some context for this week's puzzle drop here. About a month or so ago, I finished all of the puzzles in Francis Heaney's "New Grids on the Block" crossword book. It was a brilliantly put-together collection of puzzles filled with just so many 90s references and homages to things that I have zero nostalgia for being a Gen-Zer. Despite this, the puzzles were amazing, and after finishing that book, I was inspired to make a 90s-themed puzzle of my own, and that's what this week's puzzle is! <a href="bigband.html">"Big Band"</a> is a Wednesday-difficulty puzzle that I tried to stuff as much 90s stuff into as I possibly could! Even if you're a Gen-Zer like me, I still think you'll have a fun time with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck guys, and happy solving!
