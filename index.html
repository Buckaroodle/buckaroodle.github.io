          Happy (early) Thanksgiving!
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a great idea for a Thanksgiving-themed crossword last week, so I started working on it. Then, midway through making it, I had ANOTHER idea for a Thanksgiving-themed crossword. My original plan was to finish making and playtesting both puzzles and then pick one of them to upload this week, but because I think they both turned out so good, I'm uploading BOTH! It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
        </p>
        <p>
          The first crossword is a <a href="threeinone.html">Tuesday-difficulty puzzle</a> that, despite being a simple theme, was a tricky one to make due to the interesting seed words. Aside from a couple difficult clues, this one shouldn't be too bad. The second crossword is a <a href="giftsfromabove.html">Wednesday-difficulty puzzle</a> that revolves around a very specific episode of a very specific television show. None of my playtesters knew the reference, but I'm sure my parents and a few people from an older demographic will understand it (notice I didn't say "old", I said "older"!). I gave it a Wednesday-difficulty tag because of its relative obscurity, but even if you don't know the show, you'll still be able to figure it out. Extra note about that one, I believe this is my first puzzle on the site that uses left-right mirror symmetry instead of the classic rotational symmetry. I always try to do rotational symmetry if I can, but this puzzle just worked so much better without it.
        </p>

          As always, I am also uploading <a href="weeklybits.html">3 more weeklies</a> to the site! I've noticed that the Nibble on average tends to take people longer to solve than the Bite. This was not my intention, but I think this is due to the fill on the Nibble being a bit more difficult for me than the Bite just because of the small size. I'll be keeping this in mind more in the future because I do want to have a consistent progression of difficulty with the puzzles. This week, I also wanted to challenge myself more with the Bit by doing a 5x5 grid with zero blocks. That means the grid contains only 5-letter entries. A couple entries are definitely harder than what I would normally accept for a Bit, but I think the clues should do most of the heavy lifting here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, I think that's enough yapping out of me. Happy solving everyone!
