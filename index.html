        <p>
          Hello everyone! This week brings new puzzles along with some website fixes!
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, you may have noticed if you did the weekly puzzles last week that the Nibble and Bite puzzles had their titles switched on their respective pages. Whoops! I apologize for that little slip-up. Secondly, my embed for both my <a href="goingrogue.html">"Going Rogue"</a> puzzle and <a href="runningstart.html">"Running Start"</a> puzzle weren't working. My diagnosis ... I just forgot to put the links in. Bruh. Finally, in the off chance that you visited my site and the font on the website looked weird, I believe that issue should be fixed now. Hopefully. Truly a collection of troubles this week. Anyways, enough of that. PUZZLES!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="weeklybits.html">Three new weekly puzzles</a> are out now (this time with correct titles)! This will be my penultimate set of weekly puzzles before I take another week-long break. Good luck to all my regular solvers!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also extremely excited to release <a href="chainlink.html">"Chain Link"</a> as my newest Thursday-difficulty puzzle! Most of my Thursday puzzles are listed as such because they include rebus squares where you'll put multiple letters in the same space. In this case, this one's a Thursday puzzle because of its extremely tricky theme. A full five seed entries with clues that will only make sense when you figure out the gimmick. I'm super proud of this puzzle, and despite its difficulty, I hope you'll give it a shot!
        </p>
        <p>
          I appreciate your patience with me and all of the issues on my site. Feel free to let me know if you see anything wrong or broken in the future. Happy solving everyone!
