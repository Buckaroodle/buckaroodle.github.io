        Happy Friday everyone!</p>
      <p>
        I don't care that it's actually Monday right now because I'm uploading THREE Friday difficulty puzzles to the site. As stated in my last post, these puzzles are filled with a lot of 2010s pop culture and modern slang phrases. I try to have my Monday-Thursday puzzles be available to everyone whether you're a young adult or my grandma. However, these Friday puzzles allow me to include a lot more niche references that I want to showcase. The puzzle <a href="archive.html">Max</a> includes a slew of video game related words and phrases, so for all the gamers out there, this one's for you!
      </p>
    <p>
      The website hosting service I've been using for the past year and a half has been giving me some trouble recently, so if the website looks worse than normal, I promise it's not my fault! I may be switching to a new service soon, and if I do, I'll make a post here letting you all know. Anyways, happy solving!

          Hello all!</p>
        <p>
          Haven't updated the website in a while (something something laziness) and so I'm throwing three more crosswords into the archive! I've got a <a href="goodforapair.html">Monday difficulty puzzle</a> meant for less experienced solvers, a <a href="turkeyplusone.html">Thursday difficulty puzzle</a> with a tricky theme, and a <a href="itselectric.html">Friday themeless puzzle</a> with a topical 15-letter entry running through the middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've got a lot more themeless puzzles in the backlog, however, I don't view them as being as difficult as the Friday puzzles already on the site. For many of them, I was inspired by Ada Nicolle's puzzles from her "A-to-Gen-Z" crossword collection. I really enjoyed going wild not just with silly and pop culture-filled clues but also including more modern and slang terms and words into the grid. If you're over the age of 30, you might be in for a ride!
      </p>
      <p>
        You also might notice the watermark at the bottom of the site is back. That'll be there for the time being until I can land myself a job and can afford to regularly spend money on small passion projects like this one. Just ignore it lol. Happy solving!

        Hey everyone!</p>
      <p>
        Starting this week with three new puzzles! <a href="notforeveryone.html">Not For Everyone</a> and <a href="backbreaking.html">Back Breaking</a> are both Tuesday difficulty, meaning they're on the easier side but may contain the occasional tricky word or clue. Both puzzles are leagues easier than <a href="quietly.html">Quietly</a>, which includes what might be my trickiest gimmick to date. It's sorta like a puzzle within a puzzle, so I wish my best of luck to any brave solvers who attempt that one.
      </p>
      <p>
          Secondly, I am now proud to announce that the <a href="archive.html">archive page</a> now has a SORTABLE TABLE! You can click on or tap the headers to sort the puzzles by title, difficulty, or by release date. I think it turned out super well and I hope it proves useful to you all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get ready for some themeless puzzles coming in the next few weeks! I made a handful of them in the recent months and I think they're some of my favorite puzzles I've ever made! I'll talk about them more next week. Happy solving!

        Update 3/3/25
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hello all!</p>
      <p>
        Oh my, it has been a hot sec since I updated this website. Partially because I had a break in making crosswords, but also partially cause I got lazy (lol). However, I now have a lot of really cool new puzzles that I've been playtesting on my Discord server, so I'm eager to put them up publicly. I do have quite the backlog of previously unreleased puzzles, so there's no better time to bring back this site than now!
      </p>
      <p>
          Starting off, I have a puzzle (<a href="footthebill.html">Foot The Bill</a>) from late last year that I designed specifically for a school project. No clue if the professor actually tried playing it, but I did technically release it publicly (from a virtually unfindable website). Next, I have a puzzle (<a href="tayday.html">Tay Day</a>) that I made specifically for my younger sister. Admittedly, I should have redesigned it to make it easier because I don't believe she ever finished it. Lastly, I have an older Sunday puzzle (<a href="oneanddone.html">One and Done</a>) that I was so proud of when I finished building it that I submitted it to the New York Times, hence why I didn't release it here. However, it got rejected (probably because I later found a puzzle in their archives with the exact same theme). Nevertheless, I'll upload it here anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that unfindable website I mentioned earlier? I made a cool background for it that I decided to use on this website instead. We're approaching a new age of Buck crossword puzzles. I still have a good amount of backlog puzzles to upload before we reach the puzzles I made recently that I'm REALLY proud of, so here's hoping I don't get lazy again. Happy solving!

        Hi everyone!</p>
      <p>
        Adding six new crosswords to the archive! Majority of them are Monday-Wednesday difficulty with one new Friday themeless puzzle as well. I'm quite satisfied with this bunch of puzzles, and the Friday puzzle is one I'm especially proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
          With this new website update, I'm also removing a puzzle that I added last update. "Musical Median", while one of my favorites of my older crosswords, doesn't hold up well to the standards that I hold myself to now. Therefore, I have removed it from my archive and will be taking time to revisit this theme later. Sorry for any inconvenience that may have caused. Anyways, happy solving!

        Update 6/5/24
      </h3>
      <p>
        Time for another batch of puzzles! I'm releasing my newest puzzle, "Big Cheese", along with nine of my older puzzles. You may notice that a lot of the puzzles I'm releasing today are marked as Tuesday difficulty. Most of them I was tempted to mark as Monday puzzles, but there were often too many difficult words or clues included for me to feel comfortable marking them as such. Nevertheless, I think this new batch has some really fun themes I'm quite proud of (especially "Breakfast Cereal" and "Nature's Gift").
      </p>
      <p>
        I did make one addition to the website that some people may find exciting. I was recently asked if my puzzles were playable offline, to which I explained that solving my puzzles through the website does require an internet connection. However, if you didn't realize, I had included a link at the bottom of each page that allows you to download the .puz file, which you can open through any application that allows you to open .puz files (I recently found the app "Puzzazz" which lets you open .puz files through it which is pretty helpful). Though, I decided I'd make an even easier option for those who may not be as tech savvy as me and allow you to download a PDF version of all of my crosswords. So now you should be able to solve my puzzles online, offline, and right off the printer if you enjoy the classic pencil and paper approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope you're all doing well so far this summer and I hope you all enjoy the crosswords! Happy solving!

      <p>
          Boy, did I give this site an overhaul or what? Figured it'd be fun to do an occasional blog post here to give updates on when I release new puzzles or make changes to the website. When I first created this website, I only uploaded my latest 10 puzzles. This is because I wanted to test the waters and see how viable putting all my puzzles here would be, and so far, it seems to be working out great!
      </p>
      <p>
          Today, I just released a new puzzle I made this month along with 9 others I made in the last few months of 2023. I still have a ton of older puzzles I need to put on this website, but I think I'll do it in smaller chunks as to make the process less tedious. I also want to make changes to some of my older puzzles as well. Some of them don't meet my standards for what I think is a good puzzle today.
      </p>
      <p>
          I'll definitely be changing website hosts in the near future so I'll be sure to update you all when that happens. I'd love any feedback you have, whether that be for a specific puzzle or for the website as a whole. You can send me a message through Discord or through my Gmail account. Happy solving!
