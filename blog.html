        <p>
          Hello all! I hope you're having a wonderful week so far. I'm excited to get into this week's puzzles, so let's do that!
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="weeklybits.html">Week 24 of weekly puzzles</a> have arrived! Best of luck to you all with them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I'd like to give some context for this week's puzzle drop here. About a month or so ago, I finished all of the puzzles in Francis Heaney's "New Grids on the Block" crossword book. It was a brilliantly put-together collection of puzzles filled with just so many 90s references and homages to things that I have zero nostalgia for being a Gen-Zer. Despite this, the puzzles were amazing, and after finishing that book, I was inspired to make a 90s-themed puzzle of my own, and that's what this week's puzzle is! <a href="bigband.html">"Big Band"</a> is a Wednesday-difficulty puzzle that I tried to stuff as much 90s stuff into as I possibly could! Even if you're a Gen-Zer like me, I still think you'll have a fun time with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck guys, and happy solving!

          Hello everyone!

        <p>
          Today is Groundhog's Day! If I had remembered that in advance, maybe I would have made some groundhog-themed puzzles. Alas, I did not. I hope Phil's doing well.

          This week, I'm excited to release a <a href="somethingtochewon.html">Wednesday-difficulty puzzle</a> that has a whopping 7 seed entries! This puzzle took me a large amount of time to construct in a satisfying way. The theme is pretty chill for a Wednesday puzzle as are the clues, but there are a good amount of difficult longer entries that I decided that to label it as such.

        <p>
          Good luck everyone, and happy solving!

          It seems the squares.io outage lasted like not even a day, so that's a relief! I figured that was a good a time as any to take my 1 week break, so I'm back now!

          This week brings us our 20th week of <a href="weeklybits.html">weekly puzzles!</a> I do expect this set of puzzles to be a bit of a nuisance to solve because they were a bit of a nuisance to make. Good luck everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I am releasing a simple <a href="lookaway.html">Tuesday-difficulty puzzle</a> with some silly clues. Not much else to say about it, but it's on the easier side so GO SOLVE IT!

        <p>
          I was preparing to upload my puzzles to squares.io (the site I use to host them and embed them in the website) and unfortunately, the site is down currently. I'm not sure for how long this will be the case, but until then, I won't be putting any new puzzles on my site. I am seriously hoping this is just a minor outage because if it isn't, then I might be in trouble :/
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus, this concludes this week's website update. As a reminder, all my puzzles are still available as .puz and .pdf files for you to either print out or upload to a different puzzle-solving website. Have a great week everyone!

        <p>
          Hello everyone! This week brings new puzzles along with some website fixes!
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, you may have noticed if you did the weekly puzzles last week that the Nibble and Bite puzzles had their titles switched on their respective pages. Whoops! I apologize for that little slip-up. Secondly, my embed for both my <a href="goingrogue.html">"Going Rogue"</a> puzzle and <a href="runningstart.html">"Running Start"</a> puzzle weren't working. My diagnosis ... I just forgot to put the links in. Bruh. Finally, in the off chance that you visited my site and the font on the website looked weird, I believe that issue should be fixed now. Hopefully. Truly a collection of troubles this week. Anyways, enough of that. PUZZLES!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="weeklybits.html">Three new weekly puzzles</a> are out now (this time with correct titles)! This will be my penultimate set of weekly puzzles before I take another week-long break. Good luck to all my regular solvers!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also extremely excited to release <a href="chainlink.html">"Chain Link"</a> as my newest Thursday-difficulty puzzle! Most of my Thursday puzzles are listed as such because they include rebus squares where you'll put multiple letters in the same space. In this case, this one's a Thursday puzzle because of its extremely tricky theme. A full five seed entries with clues that will only make sense when you figure out the gimmick. I'm super proud of this puzzle, and despite its difficulty, I hope you'll give it a shot!
        </p>
        <p>
          I appreciate your patience with me and all of the issues on my site. Feel free to let me know if you see anything wrong or broken in the future. Happy solving everyone!

        <p>
          I'm very excited to have <a href="goingrogue.html">Going Rogue</a> as my first puzzle released in 2026! Not only is this a tougher Thursday-difficulty puzzle, but its theme is also referencing an indie video game. So, in terms of audience, there's maybe like 4 people who'll really enjoy this one. I really do enjoy making puzzles that reference my niche interests though, so I'm not apologizing. I did make the puzzle slightly easier since the playtesting phase, so maybe it won't be as tough now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck everyone, and happy solving!

          Here we are. The last website update of 2025! And thus, the last crossword drop of the year!
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, a quick shoutout to my sister for catching a small typo in my <a href="week15bite.html">Week 15 Bite</a> puzzle which will be accompanied by an apology to Carly Rae Jeps<u><b>e</b></u>n and not Carly Rae Jeps<b><u>o</u></b>n. Remember that if you spot a typo or error in one of my puzzles, feel free to contact me either through email or Discord. And for those who know me personally, you can even call me ... maybe :)
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="weeklybits.html">My last 3 weekly puzzles of the year</a> are here and ready for you to solve! Best of luck everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I have <a href="runningstart.html">a Monday-difficulty puzzle</a> ready for solving too. It's got a very simple but subtle theme that, if you can figure it out, will definitely aid you in figuring out the theme entries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't wanna make my blog post too long here, but I do really want to give a thank you to anybody reading this post right now. This website and all the puzzles have been such a passion project of mine for the past couple years, and it truly means so much to me that anybody plays my puzzles in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you all, and I'll see you in 2026! Happy solving!

          Happy last day of Hanukkah! Also, I'm sick!
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I was sick for a good bit of this week. Spent a good amount of time sitting in bed coughing and sneezing. However, it gave me a good amount of time to not only play some crossword puzzles, but work on some of my own!
        </p>
        <p>
          I've got the <a href="weeklybits.html">three new weekly puzzles</a> ready for solving! I found the Bite to be particularly difficult to satisfyingly fill this week, so I apologize in advance if that one feels a little half-baked.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd like a full-sized crossword that's on the easier side while still having some interesting clues, <a href="barelybare.html">"Barely Bare"</a> is a Tuesday-difficulty release with a simple theme that includes some unique grid entries. Those grid entries are the reason it's a Tuesday rather than a Monday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm already feeling much better than I was yesterday, so I hope to be fully recovered by either tomorrow or the next day. Only time will tell, I suppose. Good luck with the puzzles everyone!

          Unfortunately, I am not releasing any Hanukkah-themed puzzles this year. However, back in 2023, I released <a href="spintowin.html">"Spin To Win"</a> for the holiday season. If you're craving a Hanukkah puzzle and haven't solved that one yet, there you go!

        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="trendstepper.html">"Trend Stepper"</a> is my new Wednesday-difficulty release. I'm such a sucker for wordplay and pop culture references in crossword puzzles. This puzzle's theme combines them in a way that I'm very proud of.

          Happy December!
        </p>
        <p>
          Shorter blog post today, but you're still getting the same usual releases here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting off. I have <a href="weeklybits.html">three new weekly puzzles!</a> With these ones, I experimented with including more 2-letter words to see if it makes the puzzles any more or less interesting. You'll have to let me know what you think :)
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I have another <a href="aussiesome.html">Friday-difficulty puzzle</a> to put on the site! I think this is the second time that I've had to edit a clue in a puzzle because it became outdated in the months it sat in my drafts. Unfortunately, there are probably many more errors that I haven't caught in puzzles already on the site. I think this is a sign that I both need to really proofread my puzzles before releasing them AND that I just need to get through this backlog faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          One last thing I'll mention is that I created a Reddit account to try and promote my puzzles on there. In the off chance you're from Reddit and reading this: Hello! I hope you like the puzzles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy solving everyone!

        </h3>
        <p>
          Happy (early) Thanksgiving!
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a great idea for a Thanksgiving-themed crossword last week, so I started working on it. Then, midway through making it, I had ANOTHER idea for a Thanksgiving-themed crossword. My original plan was to finish making and playtesting both puzzles and then pick one of them to upload this week, but because I think they both turned out so good, I'm uploading BOTH! It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
        </p>
        <p>
          The first crossword is a Tuesday-difficulty puzzle that, despite being a simple theme, was a tricky one to make due to the interesting seed words. Aside from a couple difficult clues, this one shouldn't be too bad. The second crossword is a Wednesday-difficulty puzzle that revolves around a very specific episode of a very specific television show. None of my playtesters knew the reference, but I'm sure my parents and a few people from an older demographic will understand it (notice I didn't say "old", I said "older"!). I gave it a Wednesday-difficulty tag because of its relative obscurity, but even if you don't know the show, you'll still be able to figure it out. Extra note about that one, I believe this is my first puzzle on the site that uses left-right mirror symmetry instead of the classic rotational symmetry. I always try to do rotational symmetry if I can, but this puzzle just worked so much better without it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, I am also uploading 3 more weeklies to the site! I've noticed that the Nibble on average tends to take people longer to solve than the Bite. This was not my intention, but I think this is due to the fill on the Nibble being a bit more difficult for me than the Bite just because of the small size. I'll be keeping this in mind more in the future because I do want to have a consistent progression of difficulty with the puzzles. This week, I also wanted to challenge myself more with the Bit by doing a 5x5 grid with zero blocks. That means the grid contains only 5-letter entries. A couple entries are definitely harder than what I would normally accept for a Bit, but I think the clues should do most of the heavy lifting here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, I think that's enough yapping out of me. Happy solving everyone!

          Hello again!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm back from my brief hiatus with a new batch of puzzles for you all! As usual, I've got <a href="weeklybits.html">3 new weekly puzzles</a> and a full-sized <a href="earsup.html">Friday puzzle</a> from the backlog!
        </p>
        <p>
          The weekly puzzles are a bit trickier than normal this week but not in an unfair way I don't think. However, I also think the clues this week are more fun and exciting. Good luck with them!
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, the same thing could be said about the Friday puzzle this week. Quite tricky with some rather silly clues (Fee-fi-___-fum (possible name for a nursery rhyme-themed Asian restaurant?) (3)). Definitely a puzzle I'm proud of!
        </p>
        <p>
          As next week is right around Thanksgiving time, I'll have a Thanksgiving puzzle finished and ready for upload. As much as I've been enjoying these pop-culture themeless puzzles, I do want to have some themed puzzles too to give some more variety to the new uploads.
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, thanks for playing my crosswords everyone! Happy solving!

          Hello everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
          The weekly puzzles I've been making, while fun, are quite the time commitment to design. Therefore, as this will be Week 10 of the weekly puzzles, I'm going to take a small break after this batch. Next Monday, there will be no new puzzles on the site. However, I plan to resume the following Monday. It'll just be a week of no puzzles. You'll all be ok, I promise!
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, this week's <a href="weeklybits.html">weekly puzzles</a> are hot and ready for solving! I suspect that this batch will be a bit harder than normal. I didn't give myself as much time to fully refine them, and that's on me. I've been pretty busy this week with schoolwork, so I partially blame that. I wish you all good luck!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another <a href="nerdstuff.html">Friday</a> puzzle has hit the site! This one's got a large amount of longer entries, so it's a bit of a beast to solve. But I know you'll all do fine :)
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy solving everyone!

          Hi guys!
        </p>
        <p>
          Anybody notice anything different about the website? Well, I have some exciting news — art! Before, my website background and logo were created by me. I am not an artist, so they looked not great. Big thanks to my sister Leah Lurie for creating both the logo and the background art! She did a great job and helped breathe some more life into this website. You can find more about her work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/leahluriedesign?igsh=MWh1bmNybmVwaWplNA==">here!</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This week's <a href="weeklybits.html">weekly puzzles</a> are out now! I think I've finally struck a good balance of difficulty with them, so I hope you all enjoy solving these ones!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also meant to say this last update, but we are now in what I'm calling "THE FRIDAY PUZZLE MARATHON"! Basically, we have now reached the part of my puzzle backlog where I made a bunch of pop culture-filled Gen-Z-pilled crosswords back-to-back. So, I hope you're all ready for a lot more of these (technically next week's puzzle is going to be the spooky one I mentioned a couple blog posts ago). This week, I'm releasing <a href="clipshow.html">"Clip Show"</a>, a themeless puzzle with 3 15-letter entries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ramble so much in these posts and I don't know if anyone actually reads them anymore. If you made it this far, congrats! Good luck on the puzzles!

          Tis the beginning of spoo-o-o-ooky season! And what's more spooky than a jumpscare of three new weekly puzzles! I suspect this week's puzzles will be generally easier than last week, but good luck anyways!
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week, I finished writing the clues for about 3 puzzles I've had stuck in limbo for a bit. Really excited for you all to play them, but first, we have <a href="hardstuff.html">a Tuesday puzzle</a> I finished constructing back in June! It's a simple theme with some basic clues that's on the easier side of a Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some ideas for some more spooky season-themed puzzles, so depending on when I get those finished, I might halt the backlog to release them on season. We'll see what happens :)

        <p>
          The puzzles from week 3 were much more difficult than I intended. Sorry! Week 4 puzzles are out now and should easier than before. They're still gonna be tricky, don't get me wrong. Just much easier than week 3. Also, I made a minor change to a clue in the Week 3 Nibble puzzle because I made a small error. Oops :/ Good luck y'all!

        <p>
          I also have <a href="endnote.html">a Wednesday-difficulty puzzle</a> for you all to try out! Simple theme with a few tricky entries here and there, but I think this puzzle has some unique, interesting, and just downright silly clues [Each letter in a viral 2019 IKEA font (4)]. I expect this puzzle to be trickier than your average Wednesday puzzle, but I believe in all of you who take it on!

          Hello everyone! I'm back with another set of weekly puzzles and a standard-sized crossword too!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Week 2 Bit, Nibble, and Bite puzzles are up! As a reminder, these puzzles are smaller than my normal puzzles at 5x5, 7x7, and 9x9 squares respectively, but this doesn't mean that they're easier than my normal puzzles! The Bit is the easiest, while the Bite is much tougher. Try and complete them as fast as you can! (BTW if you want to see your timer, click the settings icon in the blue bar in the puzzle window and enable "Show Timer"). If you missed out on last week's puzzles, they are still available to play with links to them underneath the current week's puzzles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's standard-sized puzzle is a really fun one! Most of the time, my crosswords have the standard rotational symmetry which can make putting in the theme words tough. However, if I think the theme is fun enough like this one, I'll switch to left-right symmetry which allows me a bit more freedom in terms of theme word length and placement. I won't spoil too much else about the puzzle, you'll just have to trust me on this one :)
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck everyone and happy solving!

          Update 9/1/25
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lots of big changes to the website today, so let's go into all of them!
        </p>
        <p>
          First and foremost, I'm going to be starting a new weekly release of puzzles! After the New York Times locked the Mini crossword behind a subscription fee (boo!), many friends of mine have no way to satisfy their tiny puzzle craving. What I am going to try and keep up with doing is releasing three smaller crossword puzzles (the Bit, the Nibble, and the Bite) every Monday for you all to complete at some point during the week. I don't have a leaderboard hosted here, but you're more than welcome to try and beat these puzzles as fast as you can! These puzzles will be similar to the NYT Mini, but I'm gonna be trying to put my own spin on things. I've got some fun ideas cooking up in my brain. The first batch of weekly puzzles are out <a href="weeklybits.html">NOW</a>, so go check them out!
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I have a couple more big boy puzzles to upload here. One of them is another <a href="imnotstupid.html">pop culture-filled Friday puzzle</a> that references Fortnite, Severence, and a 2016 meme you've all forgotten about. The other is a <a href="thissongslaps.html">chill Tuesday puzzle</a> that, now that I'm looking at it, also has a good amount of pop culture in it (Star Wars, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Super Smash Bros to name a few).
        </p>
        <p>
          Last on the docket is a less exciting but pretty cool addition. As many of you know, I am in college for game design right now. I've got quite a few projects under my belt and am currently working on at least 3 more that I can name. If you're interested, <a href="portfolio.html">my portfolio</a> is now being hosted on this site, so you can check it out if you're a game studio executive or just really bored.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addition of weekly puzzles should force me to update this site on a more consistent basis, so I'll probably be spacing out the release of my bigger puzzles a bit more. That or I'll immediately bail on updating the site weekly when it gets too tedious. We'll see what happens. Happy solving everyone!

          Huge news!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am so excited to finally announce that I am now the proud owner of my own web domain! Even if my website changes hosts, you'll always be able to find it with buckscrosswords.xyz! I honestly wish I had done this months earlier. Huzzah!
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, new crosswords! My dad told me he tried one of the Friday puzzles I had uploaded last time and said he was very lost which makes sense cause they were all Gen-Z-pilled. Don't worry Dad, I've got some more approachable puzzles right here!. <a href="schoolslice.html">School Slice</a> is a more beginner-friendly puzzle, however I gave it a Tuesday difficulty rating instead of a Monday rating because of a few particularly tricky and deceptive clues [Tech company that sticks in your brain? (9)]. <a href="alphabeticalorder.html">Alphabetical Order</a> has a simple theme with some really silly clues that make me chuckle [Diet that, according to my research, does not require eating dinosaurs (5)]. Lastly, <a href="bollards.html">Bollards</a> is another pop culture-filled themeless puzzle containing references that my dad will never in a million years understand [Bunny-like character from YouTube's "The Amazing Digital Circus" (3)].
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you all find the new domain as cool and exciting as I do, and hey, maybe I'll get a fun logo in the near future lol. Happy solving!

        Happy Friday everyone!</p>
      <p>
        I don't care that it's actually Monday right now because I'm uploading THREE Friday difficulty puzzles to the site. As stated in my last post, these puzzles are filled with a lot of 2010s pop culture and modern slang phrases. I try to have my Monday-Thursday puzzles be available to everyone whether you're a young adult or my grandma. However, these Friday puzzles allow me to include a lot more niche references that I want to showcase. The puzzle <a href="max.html">Max</a> includes a slew of video game related words and phrases, so for all the gamers out there, this one's for you!
      </p>
    <p>
      The website hosting service I've been using for the past year and a half has been giving me some trouble recently, so if the website looks worse than normal, I promise it's not my fault! I may be switching to a new service soon, and if I do, I'll make a post here letting you all know. Anyways, happy solving!

          Hello all!</p>
        <p>
          Haven't updated the website in a while (something something laziness) and so I'm throwing three more crosswords into the archive! I've got a <a href="goodforapair.html">Monday difficulty puzzle</a> meant for less experienced solvers, a <a href="turkeyplusone.html">Thursday difficulty puzzle</a> with a tricky theme, and a <a href="itselectric.html">Friday themeless puzzle</a> with a topical 15-letter entry running through the middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've got a lot more themeless puzzles in the backlog, however, I don't view them as being as difficult as the Friday puzzles already on the site. For many of them, I was inspired by Ada Nicolle's puzzles from her "A-to-Gen-Z" crossword collection. I really enjoyed going wild not just with silly and pop culture-filled clues but also including more modern and slang terms and words into the grid. If you're over the age of 30, you might be in for a ride!
      </p>
      <p>
        You also might notice the watermark at the bottom of the site is back. That'll be there for the time being until I can land myself a job and can afford to regularly spend money on small passion projects like this one. Just ignore it lol. Happy solving!

      <p>
        Hey everyone!</p>
      <p>
        Starting this week with three new puzzles! <a href="notforeveryone.html">Not For Everyone</a> and <a href="backbreaking.html">Back Breaking</a> are both Tuesday difficulty, meaning they're on the easier side but may contain the occasional tricky word or clue. Both puzzles are leagues easier than <a href="quietly.html">Quietly</a>, which includes what might be my trickiest gimmick to date. It's sorta like a puzzle within a puzzle, so I wish my best of luck to any brave solvers who attempt that one.
      </p>
      <p>
          Secondly, I am now proud to announce that the <a href="archive.html">archive page</a> now has a SORTABLE TABLE! You can click on or tap the headers to sort the puzzles by title, difficulty, or by release date. I think it turned out super well and I hope it proves useful to you all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get ready for some themeless puzzles coming in the next few weeks! I made a handful of them in the recent months and I think they're some of my favorite puzzles I've ever made! I'll talk about them more next week. Happy solving!

        Update 3/3/25
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hello all!</p>
      <p>
        Oh my, it has been a hot sec since I updated this website. Partially because I had a break in making crosswords, but also partially cause I got lazy (lol). However, I now have a lot of really cool new puzzles that I've been playtesting on my Discord server, so I'm eager to put them up publicly. I do have quite the backlog of previously unreleased puzzles, so there's no better time to bring back this site than now!
      </p>
      <p>
          Starting off, I have a puzzle (<a href="footthebill.html">Foot The Bill</a>) from late last year that I designed specifically for a school project. No clue if the professor actually tried playing it, but I did technically release it publicly (from a virtually unfindable website). Next, I have a puzzle (<a href="tayday.html">Tay Day</a>) that I made specifically for my younger sister. Admittedly, I should have redesigned it to make it easier because I don't believe she ever finished it. Lastly, I have an older Sunday puzzle (<a href="oneanddone.html">One and Done</a>) that I was so proud of when I finished building it that I submitted it to the New York Times, hence why I didn't release it here. However, it got rejected (probably because I later found a puzzle in their archives with the exact same theme). Nevertheless, I'll upload it here anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that unfindable website I mentioned earlier? I made a cool background for it that I decided to use on this website instead. We're approaching a new age of Buck crossword puzzles. I still have a good amount of backlog puzzles to upload before we reach the puzzles I made recently that I'm REALLY proud of, so here's hoping I don't get lazy again. Happy solving!

      <p>
        Hi everyone!</p>
      <p>
        Adding six new crosswords to the archive! Majority of them are Monday-Wednesday difficulty with one new Friday themeless puzzle as well. I'm quite satisfied with this bunch of puzzles, and the Friday puzzle is one I'm especially proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
          With this new website update, I'm also removing a puzzle that I added last update. "Musical Median", while one of my favorites of my older crosswords, doesn't hold up well to the standards that I hold myself to now. Therefore, I have removed it from my archive and will be taking time to revisit this theme later. Sorry for any inconvenience that may have caused. Anyways, happy solving!

        Update 6/5/24
      </h3>
      <p>
        Time for another batch of puzzles! I'm releasing my newest puzzle, "Big Cheese", along with nine of my older puzzles. You may notice that a lot of the puzzles I'm releasing today are marked as Tuesday difficulty. Most of them I was tempted to mark as Monday puzzles, but there were often too many difficult words or clues included for me to feel comfortable marking them as such. Nevertheless, I think this new batch has some really fun themes I'm quite proud of (especially "Breakfast Cereal" and "Nature's Gift").
      </p>
      <p>
        I did make one addition to the website that some people may find exciting. I was recently asked if my puzzles were playable offline, to which I explained that solving my puzzles through the website does require an internet connection. However, if you didn't realize, I had included a link at the bottom of each page that allows you to download the .puz file, which you can open through any application that allows you to open .puz files (I recently found the app "Puzzazz" which lets you open .puz files through it which is pretty helpful). Though, I decided I'd make an even easier option for those who may not be as tech savvy as me and allow you to download a PDF version of all of my crosswords. So now you should be able to solve my puzzles online, offline, and right off the printer if you enjoy the classic pencil and paper approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope you're all doing well so far this summer and I hope you all enjoy the crosswords! Happy solving!

          Boy, did I give this site an overhaul or what? Figured it'd be fun to do an occasional blog post here to give updates on when I release new puzzles or make changes to the website. When I first created this website, I only uploaded my latest 10 puzzles. This is because I wanted to test the waters and see how viable putting all my puzzles here would be, and so far, it seems to be working out great!
      </p>
      <p>
          Today, I just released a new puzzle I made this month along with 9 others I made in the last few months of 2023. I still have a ton of older puzzles I need to put on this website, but I think I'll do it in smaller chunks as to make the process less tedious. I also want to make changes to some of my older puzzles as well. Some of them don't meet my standards for what I think is a good puzzle today.
      </p>
      <p>
          I'll definitely be changing website hosts in the near future so I'll be sure to update you all when that happens. I'd love any feedback you have, whether that be for a specific puzzle or for the website as a whole. You can send me a message through Discord or through my Gmail account. Happy solving!
