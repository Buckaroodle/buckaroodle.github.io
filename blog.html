          Happy October everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
          Tis the beginning of spoo-o-o-ooky season! And what's more spooky than a jumpscare of three new weekly puzzles! I suspect this week's puzzles will be generally easier than last week, but good luck anyways!
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week, I finished writing the clues for about 3 puzzles I've had stuck in limbo for a bit. Really excited for you all to play them, but first, we have <a href="contactme.html">a Tuesday puzzle</a> I finished constructing back in June! It's a simple theme with some basic clues that's on the easier side of a Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some ideas for some more spooky season-themed puzzles, so depending on when I get those finished, I might halt the backlog to release them on season. We'll see what happens :)
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy solving everyone!

          Week 5 of weekly puzzles are now live! I'd recommmend doing these ones in order from easiest to hardest. Might be helpful to you :)

        <p>
          Another <a href="toosweet.html">pop culture-filled puzzle</a> is here! I orginially wrote the clues for this one in early 2025, so I had to change the clue "Band with an upcoming "Long Live the Black Parade" tour, briefly" because I released this puzzle so late. Whoops, my bad! This puzzle is filled with silly stuff so I hope you all enjoy it!

          Hello once again everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
          The puzzles from week 3 were much more difficult than I intended. Sorry! Week 4 puzzles are out now and should easier than before. They're still gonna be tricky, don't get me wrong. Just much easier than week 3. Also, I made a minor change to a clue in the Week 3 Nibble puzzle because I made a small error. Oops :/ Good luck y'all! 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have <a href="endnote.html">a Wednesday-difficulty puzzle</a> for you all to try out! Simple theme with a few tricky entries here and there, but I think this puzzle has some unique, interesting, and just downright silly clues [Each letter in a viral 2019 IKEA font (4)]. I expect this puzzle to be trickier than your average Wednesday puzzle, but I believe in all of you who take it on!

          Update 9/8/25
        </h3>
        <p>
          Hello everyone! I'm back with another set of weekly puzzles and a standard-sized crossword too!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Week 2 Bit, Nibble, and Bite puzzles are up! As a reminder, these puzzles are smaller than my normal puzzles at 5x5, 7x7, and 9x9 squares respectively, but this doesn't mean that they're easier than my normal puzzles! The Bit is the easiest, while the Bite is much tougher. Try and complete them as fast as you can! (BTW if you want to see your timer, click the settings icon in the blue bar in the puzzle window and enable "Show Timer"). If you missed out on last week's puzzles, they are still available to play with links to them underneath the current week's puzzles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today's standard-sized puzzle is a really fun one! Most of the time, my crosswords have the standard rotational symmetry which can make putting in the theme words tough. However, if I think the theme is fun enough like this one, I'll switch to left-right symmetry which allows me a bit more freedom in terms of theme word length and placement. I won't spoil too much else about the puzzle, you'll just have to trust me on this one :)
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck everyone and happy solving!

          Update 9/1/25
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lots of big changes to the website today, so let's go into all of them!
        </p>
        <p>
          First and foremost, I'm going to be starting a new weekly release of puzzles! After the New York Times locked the Mini crossword behind a subscription fee (boo!), many friends of mine have no way to satisfy their tiny puzzle craving. What I am going to try and keep up with doing is releasing three smaller crossword puzzles (the Bit, the Nibble, and the Bite) every Monday for you all to complete at some point during the week. I don't have a leaderboard hosted here, but you're more than welcome to try and beat these puzzles as fast as you can! These puzzles will be similar to the NYT Mini, but I'm gonna be trying to put my own spin on things. I've got some fun ideas cooking up in my brain. The first batch of weekly puzzles are out <a href="weeklybits.html">NOW</a>, so go check them out!
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I have a couple more big boy puzzles to upload here. One of them is another <a href="imnotstupid.html">pop culture-filled Friday puzzle</a> that references Fortnite, Severence, and a 2016 meme you've all forgotten about. The other is a <a href="thissongslaps.html">chill Tuesday puzzle</a> that, now that I'm looking at it, also has a good amount of pop culture in it (Star Wars, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Super Smash Bros to name a few).
        </p>
        <p>
          Last on the docket is a less exciting but pretty cool addition. As many of you know, I am in college for game design right now. I've got quite a few projects under my belt and am currently working on at least 3 more that I can name. If you're interested, <a href="portfolio.html">my portfolio</a> is now being hosted on this site, so you can check it out if you're a game studio executive or just really bored.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addition of weekly puzzles should force me to update this site on a more consistent basis, so I'll probably be spacing out the release of my bigger puzzles a bit more. That or I'll immediately bail on updating the site weekly when it gets too tedious. We'll see what happens. Happy solving everyone!

        <p>
          Huge news!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am so excited to finally announce that I am now the proud owner of my own web domain! Even if my website changes hosts, you'll always be able to find it with buckscrosswords.xyz! I honestly wish I had done this months earlier. Huzzah!
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, new crosswords! My dad told me he tried one of the Friday puzzles I had uploaded last time and said he was very lost which makes sense cause they were all Gen-Z-pilled. Don't worry Dad, I've got some more approachable puzzles right here!. <a href="schoolslice.html">School Slice</a> is a more beginner-friendly puzzle, however I gave it a Tuesday difficulty rating instead of a Monday rating because of a few particularly tricky and deceptive clues [Tech company that sticks in your brain? (9)]. <a href="alphabeticalorder.html">Alphabetical Order</a> has a simple theme with some really silly clues that make me chuckle [Diet that, according to my research, does not require eating dinosaurs (5)]. Lastly, <a href="bollards.html">Bollards</a> is another pop culture-filled themeless puzzle containing references that my dad will never in a million years understand [Bunny-like character from YouTube's "The Amazing Digital Circus" (3)].
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you all find the new domain as cool and exciting as I do, and hey, maybe I'll get a fun logo in the near future lol. Happy solving!

        Happy Friday everyone!</p>
      <p>
        I don't care that it's actually Monday right now because I'm uploading THREE Friday difficulty puzzles to the site. As stated in my last post, these puzzles are filled with a lot of 2010s pop culture and modern slang phrases. I try to have my Monday-Thursday puzzles be available to everyone whether you're a young adult or my grandma. However, these Friday puzzles allow me to include a lot more niche references that I want to showcase. The puzzle <a href="max.html">Max</a> includes a slew of video game related words and phrases, so for all the gamers out there, this one's for you!
      </p>
    <p>
      The website hosting service I've been using for the past year and a half has been giving me some trouble recently, so if the website looks worse than normal, I promise it's not my fault! I may be switching to a new service soon, and if I do, I'll make a post here letting you all know. Anyways, happy solving!

          Hello all!</p>
        <p>
          Haven't updated the website in a while (something something laziness) and so I'm throwing three more crosswords into the archive! I've got a <a href="goodforapair.html">Monday difficulty puzzle</a> meant for less experienced solvers, a <a href="turkeyplusone.html">Thursday difficulty puzzle</a> with a tricky theme, and a <a href="itselectric.html">Friday themeless puzzle</a> with a topical 15-letter entry running through the middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've got a lot more themeless puzzles in the backlog, however, I don't view them as being as difficult as the Friday puzzles already on the site. For many of them, I was inspired by Ada Nicolle's puzzles from her "A-to-Gen-Z" crossword collection. I really enjoyed going wild not just with silly and pop culture-filled clues but also including more modern and slang terms and words into the grid. If you're over the age of 30, you might be in for a ride!
      </p>
      <p>
        You also might notice the watermark at the bottom of the site is back. That'll be there for the time being until I can land myself a job and can afford to regularly spend money on small passion projects like this one. Just ignore it lol. Happy solving!

        Hey everyone!</p>
      <p>
        Starting this week with three new puzzles! <a href="notforeveryone.html">Not For Everyone</a> and <a href="backbreaking.html">Back Breaking</a> are both Tuesday difficulty, meaning they're on the easier side but may contain the occasional tricky word or clue. Both puzzles are leagues easier than <a href="quietly.html">Quietly</a>, which includes what might be my trickiest gimmick to date. It's sorta like a puzzle within a puzzle, so I wish my best of luck to any brave solvers who attempt that one.
      </p>
      <p>
          Secondly, I am now proud to announce that the <a href="archive.html">archive page</a> now has a SORTABLE TABLE! You can click on or tap the headers to sort the puzzles by title, difficulty, or by release date. I think it turned out super well and I hope it proves useful to you all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get ready for some themeless puzzles coming in the next few weeks! I made a handful of them in the recent months and I think they're some of my favorite puzzles I've ever made! I'll talk about them more next week. Happy solving!

        Update 3/3/25
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hello all!</p>
      <p>
        Oh my, it has been a hot sec since I updated this website. Partially because I had a break in making crosswords, but also partially cause I got lazy (lol). However, I now have a lot of really cool new puzzles that I've been playtesting on my Discord server, so I'm eager to put them up publicly. I do have quite the backlog of previously unreleased puzzles, so there's no better time to bring back this site than now!
      </p>
      <p>
          Starting off, I have a puzzle (<a href="footthebill.html">Foot The Bill</a>) from late last year that I designed specifically for a school project. No clue if the professor actually tried playing it, but I did technically release it publicly (from a virtually unfindable website). Next, I have a puzzle (<a href="tayday.html">Tay Day</a>) that I made specifically for my younger sister. Admittedly, I should have redesigned it to make it easier because I don't believe she ever finished it. Lastly, I have an older Sunday puzzle (<a href="oneanddone.html">One and Done</a>) that I was so proud of when I finished building it that I submitted it to the New York Times, hence why I didn't release it here. However, it got rejected (probably because I later found a puzzle in their archives with the exact same theme). Nevertheless, I'll upload it here anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that unfindable website I mentioned earlier? I made a cool background for it that I decided to use on this website instead. We're approaching a new age of Buck crossword puzzles. I still have a good amount of backlog puzzles to upload before we reach the puzzles I made recently that I'm REALLY proud of, so here's hoping I don't get lazy again. Happy solving!

      <p>
        Hi everyone!</p>
      <p>
        Adding six new crosswords to the archive! Majority of them are Monday-Wednesday difficulty with one new Friday themeless puzzle as well. I'm quite satisfied with this bunch of puzzles, and the Friday puzzle is one I'm especially proud of.
      </p>
      <p>
          With this new website update, I'm also removing a puzzle that I added last update. "Musical Median", while one of my favorites of my older crosswords, doesn't hold up well to the standards that I hold myself to now. Therefore, I have removed it from my archive and will be taking time to revisit this theme later. Sorry for any inconvenience that may have caused. Anyways, happy solving!

        Time for another batch of puzzles! I'm releasing my newest puzzle, "Big Cheese", along with nine of my older puzzles. You may notice that a lot of the puzzles I'm releasing today are marked as Tuesday difficulty. Most of them I was tempted to mark as Monday puzzles, but there were often too many difficult words or clues included for me to feel comfortable marking them as such. Nevertheless, I think this new batch has some really fun themes I'm quite proud of (especially "Breakfast Cereal" and "Nature's Gift").

        I did make one addition to the website that some people may find exciting. I was recently asked if my puzzles were playable offline, to which I explained that solving my puzzles through the website does require an internet connection. However, if you didn't realize, I had included a link at the bottom of each page that allows you to download the .puz file, which you can open through any application that allows you to open .puz files (I recently found the app "Puzzazz" which lets you open .puz files through it which is pretty helpful). Though, I decided I'd make an even easier option for those who may not be as tech savvy as me and allow you to download a PDF version of all of my crosswords. So now you should be able to solve my puzzles online, offline, and right off the printer if you enjoy the classic pencil and paper approach.

        Hope you're all doing well so far this summer and I hope you all enjoy the crosswords! Happy solving!

          Boy, did I give this site an overhaul or what? Figured it'd be fun to do an occasional blog post here to give updates on when I release new puzzles or make changes to the website. When I first created this website, I only uploaded my latest 10 puzzles. This is because I wanted to test the waters and see how viable putting all my puzzles here would be, and so far, it seems to be working out great!
      </p>

          Today, I just released a new puzzle I made this month along with 9 others I made in the last few months of 2023. I still have a ton of older puzzles I need to put on this website, but I think I'll do it in smaller chunks as to make the process less tedious. I also want to make changes to some of my older puzzles as well. Some of them don't meet my standards for what I think is a good puzzle today.
      </p>

          I'll definitely be changing website hosts in the near future so I'll be sure to update you all when that happens. I'd love any feedback you have, whether that be for a specific puzzle or for the website as a whole. You can send me a message through Discord or through my Gmail account. Happy solving!
